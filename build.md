# Retail AI Assistant Enhancement - Build Log

## Project Overview
Transforming basic retail AI assistant into enterprise-grade solution with vector database, RAG architecture, and advanced features.

## Technical Stack Decisions
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB (local)
- **Main Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Voice Services**: Deferred to later phase
- **AI/LLM**: Groq LLM (existing)
- **Embeddings**: sentence-transformers
- **Caching**: Redis

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Vector Database & RAG Foundation ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Goal**: Implement semantic search with <200ms response time

#### Tasks:
- [x] Set up ChromaDB vector database
- [x] Generate product embeddings using sentence-transformers
- [x] Implement hybrid search (vector + traditional filters)
- [x] Create RAG pipeline with context injection
- [x] Update product recommendation system
- [x] Add confidence scoring for recommendations

#### Files Created/Modified:
- [x] `/app/vector_db.py` - ChromaDB setup and operations
- [x] `/app/rag_system.py` - RAG implementation
- [x] `/app/main.py` - Updated with vector search integration
- [x] `/app/requirements.txt` - Added new dependencies

#### Performance Results:
- ✅ Vector database initialized with 220 products
- ✅ Embedding model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions)
- ✅ Semantic search working with similarity scoring
- ✅ RAG system operational with confidence scoring
- ✅ Response time: <200ms for vector queries
- ✅ Fallback to legacy recommender if needed

### Phase 2: Database Migration & Advanced Features 🔄
**Status**: Pending
**Goal**: Migrate from JSON to PostgreSQL with advanced conversation engine

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Create proper database schemas
- [ ] Migrate product data from JSON to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Implement advanced conversation engine with memory
- [ ] Add Redis caching layer
- [ ] Create staff dashboard with analytics
- [ ] Add conversation logs and session management

#### Files to Create/Modify:
- [ ] `/app/database.py` - PostgreSQL setup and models
- [ ] `/app/conversation_engine.py` - Advanced conversation management
- [ ] `/app/staff_dashboard.py` - Staff interface
- [ ] `/app/analytics.py` - Analytics and reporting
- [ ] `/app/cache.py` - Redis caching implementation

### Phase 3: Voice Integration 🔄
**Status**: Deferred
**Goal**: Complete TTS/STT implementation

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Choose voice service provider (Azure/Google/ElevenLabs)
- [ ] Implement TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- [ ] Implement STT (Speech-to-Text)
- [ ] Add voice UI components
- [ ] Implement audio queue management
- [ ] Add wake word detection

### Phase 4: Kiosk Optimization & Production Features 🔄
**Status**: Pending
**Goal**: Production-ready deployment with offline capabilities

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement offline capabilities with local caching
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create deployment architecture
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement security features
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing

## Current Status Summary

## Performance Targets
- **Vector Search**: <200ms response time
- **Product Recommendations**: >90% relevance
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **User Experience**: <3 steps to find relevant products

## API Keys Required
- [ ] GROQ_API_KEY (existing)
- [ ] PINECONE_API_KEY (not needed - using ChromaDB)
- [ ] Any other keys as needed

## Test Results & Validation

### Vector Database Tests ✅
- **Product Loading**: Successfully loaded 220 products
- **Embedding Generation**: All products vectorized with all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **Semantic Search**: Query "elegant engagement ring" returns 3 relevant results
- **Similarity Scoring**: Working with confidence levels (high/medium/low)
- **Performance**: <200ms response time achieved

### RAG System Tests ✅
- **Integration**: Successfully integrated with existing LLM pipeline
- **Fallback**: Graceful fallback to legacy recommender if needed
- **Context Injection**: Enhanced prompts with product context
- **Confidence Scoring**: Implemented for recommendation quality

### API Endpoint Tests ✅
- **Chat Endpoint**: `/chat` - Working with enhanced recommendations
- **Admin Endpoints**: 
  - `/admin/vector-stats` - System statistics
  - `/admin/test-vector-search` - Vector search testing
- **Frontend**: Static file serving working correctly

### System Status ✅
- **Backend**: Running on port 8001 via supervisor
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB with 220 products
- **RAG System**: Active with enhanced recommendations
- **Legacy Fallback**: Available for reliability
